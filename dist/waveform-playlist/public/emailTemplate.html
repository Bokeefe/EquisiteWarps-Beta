                      <h3>Wut is all this? </h3>
                       <span>The idea behind this audio game is
                       based on the artists's game:
                       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse" >Exquisite Corpse.</a>
                       Whoever starts the new Warp (admin)
                      sets the amount of people they want to
                      contribute to it and also they put in
                      the first audio/track. Then they cut
                      just a snippet off the end to send to
                      the next user. The next warper will not
                      be able to hear anything before this
                      snippet. That warper should take in the
                      song snippet or sentence and use it as
                      inspiration to add their bit.
                      And so on...and so on...
                      Until the number of contributers is
                      reached. Then the warp is unlocked.
                      Everyone can play the whole creation
                      and download a WAV file of the whole
                      damn thing.<br><br>
                      The idea is for a bunch of people to work on a song or mixtape together without really knowing any part of the bigger picture of the project until it is finished.</span>
